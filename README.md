Through my analysis I was able to identified that through the years, gross rent has been having a more rapidly increased when compared to sale price. Even when I analyzed from 2010 to 2011, where sale price had a decrease of 0.07%. Gross rent had a increase of 0.23%. And when putting both average on a graph we can see the difference between them.

# Conclusion
My conclusion through my analysis is that gross rent and sale price are to some extend correlated. As more proprities become available to rent, the less properties are for sale which then makes the price to decrease while gross rent goes up.
